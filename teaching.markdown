A collection of pedagogical resources from my time in academia and beyond. I also presented on my "[mathematical outreach history](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11_8vI2DWcHWO4Vqi2XO9bsScoX3W5yS8vOdP-Ff7mhc/edit?usp=sharing)" for the University of Utah student math club.

# PDEs for Engineers

A series of lecture videos for the University of Utah Math 3150 "PDEs for Engineers" course: [youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWPYPlMSEPxjSeKAlzY_3DlZUytAsmTdX).

Lectures were based on [Haberman's Applied PDEs with Fourier Series and BVPs](https://www.pearson.com/en-us/subject-catalog/p/applied-partial-differential-equations-with-fourier-series-and-boundary-value-problems-classic-version/P200000006203/9780137549702), and covered (generally) chapters
1. heat equation basics,
2. separation of variables,
3. Fourier series, 
4. wave equation basics,
10. heat and wave equation on infinite domains.



# TDA for Computational Biologists

Slides and other course documents for the UNC-Chapel Hill Math 891.006 "Topological Data Analysis" (TDA) course. This course was originally offered as an [NIH BD2K course](https://bd2k.web.unc.edu/2020-topological-data-analysis-math891-006/) introducing math, computer science, and computational biology students to the basics of TDA and using TDA on data.

Available materials are:

# Chapel Hill Math Circle Worksheets

I co-led the High School section of the [Chapel Hill Math Circle](https://chapelhillmathcircle.org) for several years. Many of the worksheets I prepared and ran for students can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GLcWVmLMuP-TzpdxpMAD54R35nAA7DPR/view).



# Workshop on Inclusive Teaching Practices

I co-organized three iterations of the "Workshop on Inclusive Teaching Practices", two at UNC-Chapel Hill and [one at the U](https://www.math.utah.edu/equity-diversity/inclusive_teaching_practices_workshop.php).



# Math Modeling for High School Students

I have led several workshops on math modeling for high school students, including
- [an hour long workshop](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19eRElOdS-sQasgTJUmwNIje0-Ujr9IX5gG0NulzLhto/edit?usp=sharing) for the virtual [IITSEC](https://www.iitsec.org),
- [week-long workshops](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lELbHa8z1TubcvJmLlv-aBjntzB9DtVM?usp=sharing) for the Chapel Hill Math Circle and Orlando Math Circle,
- [a series of youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLf_ipOSbWC87csMGb7Si8g6Rk_tjaPJ_K) in collaboration with the Society of Industrial and Applied Math.
