# Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics
* SIAM Diversity Advisory Commitee
    * starting January 2025 
    * "The purpose of the Diversity Advisory Committee (DAC) is to advise SIAM on policy issues that will broaden the participation of groups that are currently underrepresented and historically marginalized in the mathematical sciences. The committee will work with the SIAM Vice-President for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (VP-EDI) to advise SIAM on these issues." - [SIAM Diversity Advisory Committee](https://www.siam.org/get-involved/connect-with-a-community/committees/diversity-advisory-committee/)

    * "The Education Committee has responsibility for supporting the Vice President for Education in SIAM activities related to education, both graduate and undergraduate. These activities include recommendations on education policy and curricula in areas relevant to SIAM; carrying out programs to promote applied mathematics and computational science; and providing advice on general policy issues in education in the mathematical sciences." - [SIAM Education Committee](https://www.siam.org/get-involved/connect-with-a-community/committees/education-committee/)
    * I led the outreach subcommittee, developing and advising on applied math activities to reach a broad k-12 audience of interested learners, as well as provide guidance on activities for SIAM members.
    * I have organized several math festival appearances for SIAM, including the National Math Festival, the USA Science and Engineering Festival, and the New York Math Festival.
