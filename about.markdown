I am a Senior Technical Marketing Specialist (colloquially, a STEM Outreach Engineer) at MathWorks. Prior to this I was:
* a Wylie Assistant Professor of math at the University of Utah;
* a graduate student in math at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
At these places I engaged in the standard young academic trifecta: research, teaching, and outreach.

So what is a STEM Outreach Engineer? I do outreach, and specific to my role at MathWorks I focus on:
1. computational thinking and technical computing,
2. math modeling,
3. data science, 
4. supporting underrepresented communities.

Much of my time is spent writing blog posts, developing demos and workshops, identifying and supporting influential and impactful STEM outreach organizations, and the like. 

I enjoy learning and continuous development/improvement, including collecting certificates. You can audit my externally validated certificates [here]({% link certifications.md %}), and/or on my LinkedIn profile.
