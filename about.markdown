I am a Senior Software Engineer at PTC, as part of the Core Geometry group for the CAD software Creo. Prior to this I was:
* a Senior Technical Marketing Specialist (colloquially, a STEM Outreach Engineer) at MathWorks;
* a Wylie Assistant Professor of math at the University of Utah;
* a graduate student in math at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
At these places I engaged in the standard young academic trifecta: research, teaching, and outreach.

I enjoy learning and continuous development/improvement, including collecting certificates. You can audit my externally validated certificates [here]({% link certifications.md %}), and/or on my LinkedIn profile.
